This is a working resume of sorts. It's a more fine-grained version of my professional accomplishments than the traditional one-page document. These are occasionally supplemented by blog posts, where appropriate, to illustrate what I've done, or what I learned from a project. 

They go in reverse order, and trail what I'm working on now by about a year, out of respect for my current employer. 

I'd be happy to chat about any of these topics in greater depth via Zoom, email, or in person!
